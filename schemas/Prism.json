	"description":"This describes a prism positioned in the light path for one or more channel available for this instrument. A prism is a block of glass or other transparent material with flat, polished surfaces, which can be viewed as an ensamble of different rigidly mounted mirrors, with each face having a permanent orientation with respect to all the others. A prism can be employed to deflect or deviate a light beam, rotate or invert an image, separate polarization states, or disperse light into its component wavelengths. An instrument may have several prisms with different factionality such as,  reflecting, polarizing, and refracting or dispersion prisms. Reflecting prisms are useful for redirecting light beams by total internal reflection. Polarizing prisms are birefringent crystals that divide incident non-polarized light into separate components polarized orthogonally to each other. Refracting prisms can be employed to bend and separate light into its component colors. These prisms are employed to produce polarized light for optical instruments such as microscopes and polarimeters.",
