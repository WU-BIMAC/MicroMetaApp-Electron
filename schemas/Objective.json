NA can be calculated by the expression n sin alpha, where n is the Refractive Index of the medium between the Lens and the Sample, and alpha is half the Angular Aperture of the Lens. NA is a measure of how much of the illumination that leaves the specimen actually passes through the Lens. The larger the NA, the more information the lens can transmit. Expected range 0.02 - 1.5.",
